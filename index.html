          <div class="question-text">
            <p>I always try to listen, observe, and understand a given situation or perspective before arriving at a decision or reacting in any manner. Disagreements are common in the electrical industry. In my experiences, cooler heads always prevail.</p>

        <!-- question 2 -->
        <article class="question">
          <div class="question-title">
            <p>Describe an instance of when you were required to take on multiple projects at once.</p>

          <div class="question-text">
            <p>Multitasking has always been one of my strengths. I have been tasked with overseeing multiple electrical projects concurrently on numerous occasions as well as multiple installations in a more subordinate role. Time management and effectively delegating work as necessary played an integral part in the success of those projects and installations.</p>

        <article class="question">

          <div class="question-text">
            <p>When training apprentices, asking questions of supervisors, or coordinating with other tradesmen, communication is key but sometimes falls short resulting in delays, or conflicts. When this has occured at previous employers, I've always apologized for the miscommunication, carefully taken the time to be more specific in what I had hoped to convey, and promptly do all i can to rectify any issues that arise from the miscommunication.</p>
